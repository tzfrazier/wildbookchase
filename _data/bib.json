    "Abstract Note": "The emergence of the World Wide Web has brought about a new type of labor activity: website production work. Web work is organized through a distinctive assemblage of mechanisms and practices, the operations, causes, and consequences of which are examined here using data from sixty New York City web workers' employment histories. Web labor is divided among diverse and fluctuating settings and takes a variety of contractual forms; individual job contents involve flexible combinations of occupational roles. The distribution of labor has involved the rapid movement of workers--sometimes in clusters or chains--among different jobs and organizations. This movement is facilitated by a range of external and intra-firm intermediaries and by qualifications emphasizing general skills and personal \"fit\" with work groups and settings. These features of web work organization stem from the convergence of a number of factors: the specific manner in which web technologies were appropriated, the influence of previous occupations and industries, fluctuations in the number, size, and labor demand of web production organizations, and the emergence of institutions, networks, and a shared culture among their participants. They have a number of specific consequences as well. First, the rise of web production has resulted in a substantial displacement of labor; it drew workers away from previous activities and continually shifted them among different organizations and industries. Second, web jobs give workers differential access to qualifications and intermediaries, and different qualifications and intermediaries lead to different types of future work; over time these constraints become path dependent, yielding distinctive labor market segments and career patterns. Finally, distributions of web labor are characterized by closures and inequalities that mirror those of more established industries. However, the heterogeneity, rapid change, and informality of allocation processes have left web workers, unlike their counterparts elsewhere, with little stable ground from which to question the legitimacy of these distributions. Overall, these findings point to larger processes by which technological and industrial change creates new systems of labor allocation, shifts workers among different settings and activities, and gives new form to old inequalities.",

    "Abstract Note": "Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) is a conceptual framework that makes it possible to analyse the forces that shape human-information interaction. This analysis can then be directly transformed to design requirements for information systems. Its approach is work-centred, rather than user-centred, as it analyses the constraints and goals that shape information behaviour in the work place, regardless of the specific individuals who are involved. Being a holistic approach, it examines simultaneously several dimensions: the environmental, organizational, social, activity, and individual. As a result, applying the framework requires a multi-disciplinary approach. It provides concepts and templates to facilitate an analysis of complex phenomena, without reducing their complexity. As a framework, it is a structure that accommodates any relevant theory, model, or method. CWA has proven to be an effective approach to the study of human information behaviour for the purpose of designing information systems.",

    "Abstract Note": "This phenomenographic research investigated variation in web professionals' understanding of information literacy. The outcome is of value for the education of practitioners both in the areas of information literacy, and web design and development. Analysis of 23 in-depth interviews with web workers from different stages of web design and development process revealed that they experience information literacy as staying informed, building a successful website, solving a problem or participating in a community of practice. The present research advances the existing understanding of the concept of information literacy, especially in an occupational context. Additionally, using the web professionals' world as the context of the study, the research also contributes to the field of website design and development by shedding light on less-researched experiences of people involved in this industry.",

Finding and indexing visual material to assist the process of ideation often fall on the designer, leading to user experiences that are less than ideal. To inform development of computer systems to assist graphic designers in the ideation phase of the design process, we conducted interviews with 15 professional graphic designers about their design process and visual information needs. Based on the study, we propose a set of requirements for an ideation-support system for graphic design.",

    "Abstract Note": "This article reports the findings of a qualitative research study that examined professional image users' knowledge of, and interest in using, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems in an attempt to clarify when and where CBIR methods might be applied. The research sought to determine the differences in the perceived usefulness of CBIR technologies among image user groups from several domains and explicate the reasons given regarding the utility of CBIR systems for their professional tasks. Twenty participants (archaeologists, architects, art historians, and artists), individuals who rely on images of cultural materials in the performance of their work, took part in the study. The findings of the study reveal that interest in CBIR methods varied among the different professional user communities. Individuals who showed an interest in these systems were primarily those concerned with the formal characteristics (i.e., color, shape, composition, and texture) of the images being sought. In contrast, those participants who expressed a strong interest in images of known items, images illustrating themes, and/or items from specific locations believe concept-based searches to be the most direct route. These image users did not see a practical application for CBIR systems in their current work routines.",

Second, we provide a broad context for the thinking expressed by those nine scholars. In building that context, we discuss a range of conceptual and application issues. The conceptual issues focus on the range of definitions for both media and literacy. The application issues include considerations about curriculum design, teaching, and the assessment of media literacy.",

    "Abstract Note": "Beginning researchers get an overview of qualitative research through a concise look at the practice of conducting research and the theory and debates that keep qualitative inquiry vibrant.   ��  Ideal for introducing the novice researcher to the theory and practice of qualitative research, this text opens students to the diverse possibilities within this inquiry approach, while helping them understand how to design and implement specific research methods. The author�۪s accessible writing style, the wealth of examples, and the numerous exercises provide opportunities for practicing and refining the skills of becoming a qualitative researcher. The new edition focuses on the development of research proposals (Ch. 2); the history and concerns of institutional review boards (IRBs) and issues qualitative researchers sometimes confront when submitting proposals (Ch. 6); greater information and examples on coding and thematic analysis, while also introducing other approaches to data analysis (Ch. 7); and arts based research through a chapter that encourages consideration of creative ways to approach and represent inquiry (Ch. 9). Chapter 10 looks at sharing research results through participation at conferences and in publications.",

I feel I can also utilize these concepts on my own research team and take them out of the classroom and into research team meetings with colleagues.\"���������������������������������������������������������������������������� �ۥDeborah Gioia, University of Maryland, Baltimore\"I really liked this book. I found myself taking notes and saying \"yes\" so many times because Maxwell captures the research process so well and provides many points worth quoting. As a faculty mentor, I particularly see the value of this book for my students who are conducting qualitative dissertations.\"���������������������������������������������������������������������������� �ۥMary S. Enright, Capella University\"The text is incredibly engaging and practical...So many of the issues raised in the book are central to qualitative research, yet often not explicitly discussed in 'public' venues.\"���������������������������������������������������������������������������� - David Carlone, The University of North Carolina at Greensboro\"I particularly like the interactive focus and believe that helps students to more realistically engage qualitative research design.�� It certainly lives up to its billing as a good guidebook, and I appreciate the fact that the author really concentrates on useful content, exercises, insights, and examples, and leaves extensive theory discussions to others.\"��������������������������������������������������������������������������������- Sharon L. Caudle, Texas A & M University",
