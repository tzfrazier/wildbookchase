I'm working on setting up a site for a future job hunt, and for a variety of reasons started to toy around with Jekyll. This post is the first of a knowledge dump, discussing what I've learned trying to tackle problems while undertaking the Jekyll problem, and will address, why Jekyll? Why now?

Jekyll is a CMS that generates a static site that can be hosted on Github as a Github Page. I first encountered it several years ago through Treehouse, and as I've toyed with beginning to learn Github, I have occasionally picked it up and dusted it off. The reasons for choosing Jekyll were simple at first, it was a light weight solution that also offered me the chance to up-skill. As I've solved a fundamental problem this go at it I feel better about seeing it through completion.

Why now? I made a list of the skills I needed to be able to pivot away from academia, after I finish my Ph.D., and SASS was at the top of my list. After punching SASS into my search to see if I had any project files form various other things with SASS files, I came across my Jekyll old Jekyll blog. I've become more confident with the terminal in the last few months because of my Raspberry Pi 3, so I thought I could tackle the major source of frustration with Jekyll for me, the inability to do citations in Jekyll on Github pages, in part, because I needed to parse the data. Reading the Jekyll documentation, and toying around with Zotero, I realized that I could export my bibliography as a JSON file, and then drop it into the _data folder, which hypothetically would let me do what I want to do. And that's how we got to where I am now.
